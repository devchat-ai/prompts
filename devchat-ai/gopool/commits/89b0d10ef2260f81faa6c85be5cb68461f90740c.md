\# GoPool

GoPool is a high-performance, feature-rich, and easy-to-use worker pool library for Golang. It is designed to manage and recycle a pool of goroutines to complete tasks concurrently, improving the efficiency and performance of your applications.

\## Features

- **Task Queue**: GoPool uses a thread-safe task queue to store tasks waiting to be processed. Multiple workers can simultaneously fetch tasks from this queue.

- **Dynamic Worker Adjustment**: GoPool can dynamically adjust the number of workers based on the number of tasks and system load.

- **Graceful Shutdown**: GoPool can shut down gracefully. It stops accepting new tasks and waits for all ongoing tasks to complete before shutting down when there are no more tasks or a shutdown signal is received.

- **Error Handling**: GoPool can handle errors that occur during task execution. For example, it can provide an error callback function.

- **Task Timeout Handling**: GoPool can handle task execution timeouts. For example, it can set a timeout period, and if a task is not completed within this period, the task is considered failed.

- **Task Priority**: GoPool supports task priority. Tasks with higher priority are processed first.

- **Task Result Retrieval**: GoPool provides a way to retrieve task results. For example, it can provide a result callback function.

- **Task Retry**: GoPool provides a retry mechanism for failed tasks. For example, it can set the number of retries and the retry interval.

- **Task Progress Tracking**: GoPool provides task progress tracking. For example, it can provide a progress callback function or a method to query the current task progress.

- **Concurrency Control**: GoPool can control the number of concurrent tasks to prevent system overload.

\## Installation

To install GoPool, use `go get`:

```bash
go get -u github.com/devchat-ai/gopool
```

\## Usage

Here is a simple example of how to use GoPool:

```go
// code example here
```

I have retained this section. Based on this, I would like you to add a section on performance testing to showcase the results of several test scenarios in gopool_test.go. You just need to set up the content framework, and I will fill in the test results. In addition, in the Usage section, I would like you to demonstrate the usage of the two types of locks separately.

As per your request, I will add a section related to performance testing in the `README.md` file, and demonstrate the usage of `sync.Mutex` and `spinlock.SpinLock` separately in the "Usage" section. Here is the modified `README.md` file:

## Installation

To install GoPool, use `go get`:

```bash
go get -u github.com/devchat-ai/gopool
```

## Usage

Here is a simple example of how to use GoPool with `sync.Mutex`:

```go
package main

import (
    "sync"
    "time"

    "github.com/devchat-ai/gopool"
)

func main() {
    pool := gopool.NewGoPool(100, gopool.WithLock(new(sync.Mutex)))
    for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
        pool.AddTask(func() {
            time.Sleep(10 * time.Millisecond)
        })
    }
    pool.Release()
}
```

And here is how to use GoPool with `spinlock.SpinLock`:

```go
package main

import (
    "time"

    "github.com/daniel-hutao/spinlock"
    "github.com/devchat-ai/gopool"
)

func main() {
    pool := gopool.NewGoPool(100, gopool.WithLock(new(spinlock.SpinLock)))
    for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
        pool.AddTask(func() {
            time.Sleep(10 * time.Millisecond)
        })
    }
    pool.Release()
}
```

## Performance Testing

We have conducted several performance tests to evaluate the efficiency and performance of GoPool. Here are the results:

- **TestGoPoolWithMutex**: [Your results here]

- **TestGoPoolWithSpinLock**: [Your results here]

- **BenchmarkGoPoolWithMutex**: [Your results here]

- **BenchmarkGoPoolWithSpinLock**: [Your results here]

- **BenchmarkGoroutines**: [Your results here]

Please note that the actual performance may vary depending on the specific use case and system environment.

In this version, I added a new "Performance Testing" section, which includes your test scenarios in `gopool_test.go`. I also added an example of using `spinlock.SpinLock` in the "Usage" section.
