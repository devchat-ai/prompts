Next, I want to add the MIT open source license.

Sure, you can create a file named `LICENSE` in the root directory of the project, and then copy the text of the MIT license into this file. Here is the text of the MIT license:

```license

You need to replace `[year]` and `[fullname]` with the current year and your full name. For example, if your name is John Doe, you can replace `[year]` with `2022` and `[fullname]` with `John Doe`.

Add a .gitignore file suitable for the current project

## ![avatar](../../assets/icons/avatar_devchat.svg) **[DevChat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=merico.devchat)**

Sure, here is a `.gitignore` file suitable for Go projects:

```gitignore
# Binaries for programs and plugins
*.exe
*.exe~
*.dll
*.so
*.dylib

# Test binary, built with `go test -c`
*.test

# Output of the go coverage tool, specifically when used with LiteIDE
*.out

# Dependency directories (remove the comment below to include it)
# vendor/

# IDE files
.idea
*.iml

# Compiled Object files, Static and Dynamic libs (Shared Objects)
*.o
*.a
*.so

# Folders
_obj
_test

# Architecture specific extensions/prefixes
*.[568vq]
[568vq].out

*.cgo1.go
*.cgo2.c
_cgo_defun.c
_cgo_gotypes.go
_cgo_export.*

_testmain.go

*.exe
*.test
*.prof
```

This `.gitignore` file will ignore common files in Go projects that do not need version control, such as compiled binary files, test output, files generated by IDEs, etc. You can modify it according to your specific needs.
