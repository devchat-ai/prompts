Next, please add an appropriate CI process to my project to ensure that the code committed to the main branch can be built normally and all unit tests pass. You can use GitHub Actions directly.

Sure, we can create a GitHub Actions workflow to run the build and unit tests every time a commit is made to the main branch. Here is a basic GitHub Actions workflow configuration file `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Set up Go
      uses: actions/setup-go@v2
      with:
        go-version: 1.16

    - name: Check out code into the Go module directory
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Get dependencies
      run: go get -v -t -d ./...

    - name: Build
      run: go build -v ./...

    - name: Test
      run: go test -v ./...
```

This workflow will run every time a commit is made to the main branch. It first sets up the Go environment, then checks out the code, gets dependencies, builds the project, and finally runs all unit tests.

You need to add this file to the `.github/workflows` directory in your project. If this directory does not exist yet, you need to create it.
