In the initial implementation, I believe GoPool should include a task queue and concurrency control. I would like you to provide the definitions of several main objects related to implementing these features. If it involves structures and interfaces, please provide method definitions. I will provide feedback based on your design, and you should start the specific coding implementation after receiving my feedback.

Alright, based on your requirements, I suggest we define the following main objects:

1. **Task**: This is an interface that represents a task that can be executed. It has a method `Execute` for executing the task.

```go
type Task interface {
    Execute() error
}
```

2. **Worker**: This is a struct that represents a worker coroutine. It has a method `Start` for starting to execute tasks.

```go
type Worker struct {
    TaskQueue chan Task
}

func (w *Worker) Start() {
    // Implementation here
}
```

3. **GoPool**: This is a struct that represents the entire Worker Pool. It has a method `AddTask` for adding tasks to the task queue; a method `Start` for starting the Worker Pool; and a method `Stop` for stopping the Worker Pool.

```go
type GoPool struct {
    Workers []*Worker
    TaskQueue chan Task
    MaxWorkers int
}

func (p *GoPool) AddTask(task Task) {
    // Implementation here
}

func (p *GoPool) Start() {
    // Implementation here
}

func (p *GoPool) Stop() {
    // Implementation here
}
```

This is just a basic design and may need to be adjusted according to actual requirements. For example, you might need to add some error handling logic, or add some configuration options, etc.

Here are some feedbacks for you:
1. The Task interface has an Execute() method, but the tasks submitted by users when using GoPool may not necessarily implement this method, so I think Task can directly be a func() type.
2. After AddTask(), GoPool should be able to automatically start assigning Workers to handle Tasks, rather than calling the Start() method again, so I think Start() is redundant.
3. It seems more appropriate to use Release() for the release of the Pool, compared to Stop().
4. Considering simplicity, I think users should get a Pool after calling NewGoPool(), and then they can keep adding tasks by calling the AddTask() method of the Pool, these tasks will be digested at the fastest speed.
Please rewrite the code considering the above opinions, and reasonably distribute it into two source files: gopool.go and worker.go.

Based on your feedback, I've made some modifications to the code. Here is the modified code:

In the `gopool.go` file:

```go
package gopool

type Task func()

type GoPool struct {
    TaskQueue  chan Task
    MaxWorkers int
    Workers    []*Worker
}

func NewGoPool(maxWorkers int) *GoPool {
    return &GoPool{
        TaskQueue:  make(chan Task),
        MaxWorkers: maxWorkers,
        Workers:    make([]*Worker, maxWorkers),
    }
}

func (p *GoPool) AddTask(task Task) {
    // Implementation here
}

func (p *GoPool) Release() {
    // Implementation here
}
```

In the `worker.go` file:

```go
package gopool

type Worker struct {
    TaskQueue chan Task
}

func NewWorker(taskQueue chan Task) *Worker {
    return &Worker{
        TaskQueue: taskQueue,
    }
}

func (w *Worker) Start() {
    // Implementation here
}
```

In this design, `Task` is a function type, and users can directly submit a function as a task. The `Start` method in the `GoPool` struct has been removed, and processing will automatically start after adding tasks. The `Stop` method has been renamed to `Release`, which is used to release the Pool. The `NewGoPool` and `NewWorker` functions have been added, and users can create a new `GoPool` or `Worker` by calling these two functions.
