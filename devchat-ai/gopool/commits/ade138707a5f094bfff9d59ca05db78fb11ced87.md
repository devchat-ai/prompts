func WithMinWorkers(minWorkers int) Option {

}
</details>

Next, I want to add Task Timeout Handling functionality:
1. Add a WithTimeout function to configure the global timeout time for goPool, this time will be passed to each worker, when this timeout time is <=0, it means no timeout; otherwise, add timeout interrupt logic when running Task in worker.start.
2. After the Task is interrupted, it should be able to return a timeout error. I don't know if this can be achieved through Context, please give a best practice.

## ![avatar](../../assets/icons/avatar_devchat.svg) **[DevChat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=merico.devchat)**

First, we need to add a `timeout` field to the `goPool` structure to store the global timeout time. Then, we can create a `WithTimeout` function to set this timeout time.

```go
// goPool represents a pool of workers.
type goPool struct {
    workers    []*worker
    maxWorkers int
    minWorkers int
    workerStack []int
    taskQueue chan task
    lock sync.Locker
    cond *sync.Cond
    timeout time.Duration  // Add timeout field
}

// WithTimeout sets the timeout for the pool.
func WithTimeout(timeout time.Duration) Option {
    return func(p *goPool) {
        p.timeout = timeout
    }
}
```

Then, we need to add timeout interrupt logic in the `worker.start` method. We can use the `context.WithTimeout` function to create a `context.Context` with a timeout time, and then check whether this `context.Context` has timed out when executing the task.

```go
func (w *worker) start(pool *goPool, workerIndex int) {
    go func() {
        for t := range w.taskQueue {
            if t != nil {
                // Create a context with timeout
                ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), pool.timeout)
                defer cancel()

                // Create a channel to receive the result of the task
                done := make(chan struct{})

                // Run the task in a separate goroutine
                go func() {
                    t()
                    close(done)
                }()

                // Wait for the task to finish or for the context to timeout
                select {
                case <-done:
                    // The task finished successfully
                case <-ctx.Done():
                    // The context timed out, the task took too long
                    fmt.Println("Task timed out")
                }
            }
            pool.pushWorker(workerIndex)
        }
    }()
}
```

In this way, if the task is not completed within the timeout time, `ctx.Done()` will return a signal, and we will know that the task has timed out. Note that we need to close the `done` channel after the task is completed, otherwise the `select` statement will always block.

The advantage of this method is that we can check whether it has timed out at any time during the execution of the task, without waiting for the task to complete. This is very useful for tasks that may take a long time to complete.

## ![avatar](../../assets/icons/avatar_spaceman.png) **User**

You overlooked one factor, timeout is an optional configuration, when timeout is not configured, the timeout logic should not be enabled.

## ![avatar](../../assets/icons/avatar_devchat.svg) **[DevChat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=merico.devchat)**

I'm sorry, I overlooked this factor. We can add a judgment in the `worker.start` method, and only enable the timeout logic when `timeout` is greater than 0. Below is the modified code:

```go
func (w *worker) start(pool *goPool, workerIndex int) {
    go func() {
        for t := range w.taskQueue {
            if t != nil {
                if pool.timeout > 0 {
                    // Create a context with timeout
                    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), pool.timeout)
                    defer cancel()

                    // Create a channel to receive the result of the task
                    done := make(chan struct{})

                    // Run the task in a separate goroutine
                    go func() {
                        t()
                        close(done)
                    }()

                    // Wait for the task to finish or for the context to timeout
                    select {
                    case <-done:
                        // The task finished successfully
                    case <-ctx.Done():
                        // The context timed out, the task took too long
                        fmt.Println("Task timed out")
                    }
                } else {
                    // If timeout is not set or is zero, just run the task
                    t()
                }
            }
            pool.pushWorker(workerIndex)
        }
    }()
}
```

In this way, we only create a `context.Context` with timeout and wait for the task to complete or timeout when `timeout` is greater than 0. If `timeout` is less than or equal to 0, we just run the task directly, without any timeout check.

\# GoPool

Welcome to GoPool, **a project where 95% of the code is generated by GPT**. You can find the corresponding list of Commit and Prompt at [pro.devchat.ai](https://pro.devchat.ai).

GoPool is a high-performance, feature-rich, and easy-to-use worker pool library for Golang. It is designed to manage and recycle a pool of goroutines to complete tasks concurrently, improving the efficiency and performance of your applications.

\## Features

- **Task Queue**: GoPool uses a thread-safe task queue to store tasks waiting to be processed. Multiple workers can simultaneously fetch tasks from this queue.

- **Dynamic Worker Adjustment**: GoPool can dynamically adjust the number of workers based on the number of tasks and system load.

- **Graceful Shutdown**: GoPool can shut down gracefully. It stops accepting new tasks and waits for all ongoing tasks to complete before shutting down when there are no more tasks or a shutdown signal is received.

- **Error Handling**: GoPool can handle errors that occur during task execution. For example, it can provide an error callback function.

- **Task Timeout Handling**: GoPool can handle task execution timeouts. For example, it can set a timeout period, and if a task is not completed within this period, the task is considered failed.

- **Task Priority**: GoPool supports task priority. Tasks with higher priority are processed first.

- **Task Result Retrieval**: GoPool provides a way to retrieve task results. For example, it can provide a result callback function.

- **Task Retry**: GoPool provides a retry mechanism for failed tasks. For example, it can set the number of retries and the retry interval.

- **Task Progress Tracking**: GoPool provides task progress tracking. For example, it can provide a progress callback function or a method to query the current task progress.

- **Concurrency Control**: GoPool can control the number of concurrent tasks to prevent system overload.

- **Lock Customization**: GoPool supports different types of locks. You can use the built-in `sync.Mutex` or a custom lock such as `spinlock.SpinLock`.

\## Installation

To install GoPool, use `go get`:

```bash
go get -u github.com/devchat-ai/gopool
```

\## Usage

Here is a simple example of how to use GoPool with `sync.Mutex`:

```go
package main

import (
    "sync"
    "time"

    "github.com/devchat-ai/gopool"
)

func main() {
    pool := gopool.NewGoPool(100)
    for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
        pool.AddTask(func() {
            time.Sleep(10 * time.Millisecond)
        })
    }
    pool.Release()
}
```

And here is how to use GoPool with `spinlock.SpinLock`:

```go
package main

import (
    "time"

    "github.com/daniel-hutao/spinlock"
    "github.com/devchat-ai/gopool"
)

func main() {
    pool := gopool.NewGoPool(100, gopool.WithLock(new(spinlock.SpinLock)))
    for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
        pool.AddTask(func() {
            time.Sleep(10 * time.Millisecond)
        })
    }
    pool.Release()
}
```

\## Dynamic Worker Adjustment

GoPool supports dynamic worker adjustment. This means that the number of workers in the pool can increase or decrease based on the number of tasks in the queue. This feature can be enabled by setting the MinWorkers option when creating the pool.

Here is an example of how to use GoPool with dynamic worker adjustment:

```go
package main

import (
    "time"

    "github.com/devchat-ai/gopool"
)

func main() {
    pool := gopool.NewGoPool(100, gopool.WithMinWorkers(50))
    for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
        pool.AddTask(func() {
            time.Sleep(10 * time.Millisecond)
        })
    }
    pool.Release()
}
```

In this example, the pool starts with 50 workers. If the number of tasks in the queue exceeds (MaxWorkers - MinWorkers) / 2 + MinWorkers, the pool will add more workers. If the number of tasks in the queue is less than MinWorkers, the pool will remove some workers.

\## Performance Testing

We have conducted several performance tests to evaluate the efficiency and performance of GoPool. Here are the results:

- **TestGoPoolWithMutex**:

```bash
$ go test -benchmem -run=^$ -bench ^BenchmarkGoPoolWithMutex$ github.com/devchat-ai/gopool

```

- **BenchmarkGoroutines**: 

```bash
$ go test -benchmem -run=^$ -bench ^BenchmarkGoroutines$ github.com/devchat-ai/gopool

PASS
ok      github.com/devchat-ai/gopool    2.410s
```

Please note that the actual performance may vary depending on the specific use case and system environment.
